Most of my projects are at <https://github.com/jakobeha> (newer) and
<https://bitbucket.org/jakobeha/> (older).

Here are projects I've worked on with others.

- **[RIR](https://github.com/reactorlabs/rir)** - A JIT compiler for the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/about.html)

Here are my own works, with links to their descriptions / source code.

- **[TreeScript](https://github.com/Jakobeha/treescript)** - A language to transform syntax for faster manipulation of source code, similar to [Lightweight multi-language syntax transformation with parser parser combinators](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3314589)
- **[TreeScript](https://github.com/Jakobeha/treescript)** - A language to transform syntax for faster manipulation of source code, similar to [Lightweight multi-language syntax transformation with parser parser combinators](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3314589). Derived from Descript
- **Descript ([v1 (Haskell)](https://bitbucket.org/jakobeha/descript-lang/src/master/) and [v2 (OCaml)](https://bitbucket.org/jakobeha/descript-ocaml/src/master/))** - A language designed to refactor itself. Descript programs can be applied to other source files, transforming them in-place

And of course, there is [this
website](https://github.com/Jakobeha/jakobeha.github.io/tree/develop).
