Most of my projects are at https://github.com/jakobeha (newer) and
https://bitbucket.org/jakobeha/ (older).

Below are major projects I have worked on, with links to their
descriptions / source code.

-  **`RIR <https://github.com/reactorlabs/rir>`__** - joint
   collaboration: A JIT compiler for the `R programming
   language <https://www.r-project.org/about.html>`__
-  **`TreeScript <https://github.com/Jakobeha/treescript>`__** - side
   project: A language to transform syntax for faster manipulation of
   source code, similar to `Lightweight multi-language syntax
   transformation with parser parser
   combinators <https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3314589>`__
-  **`TreeScript <https://github.com/Jakobeha/treescript>`__** - side
   project: A language to transform syntax for faster manipulation of
   source code, similar to `Lightweight multi-language syntax
   transformation with parser parser
   combinators <https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3314589>`__. Derived
   from Descript
-  **Descript (`v1
   (Haskell) <https://bitbucket.org/jakobeha/descript-lang/src/master/>`__
   and `v2
   (Ocaml) <https://bitbucket.org/jakobeha/descript-ocaml/src/master/>`__)**
   - side project: A language designed to refactor itself. Descript
   programs can be applied to other source files, transforming them
   in-place

And of course, there is `this
website <https://github.com/Jakobeha/jakobeha-website>`__.
