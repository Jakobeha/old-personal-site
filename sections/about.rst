Bio
---

I'm a Northeastern University junior studying Computer Science, planning
to go to graduate school. I'm currently researching programming language
design, static analysis, and developer tools, although I'm interested in
other media creation tools as well. My goal is to make it easier for
more people to create digital content, and improve existing content.
