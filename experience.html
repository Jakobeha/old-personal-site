        <h1>Experience</h1> <h2 id="prior-september-2017">Prior September 2017</h2>
<p>I initially started programming as a hobby, working on various side projects. In high school I took AP Computer Science A + AP Computer Science Principles.</p>
<h2 id="northeastern-university-september-2017---january-2020">Northeastern University: September 2017 - January 2020</h2>
<p>I graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and a GPA of 3.877 / 4. Notable classes include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CS2500 Fundamentals of Computer Science 1</strong>: Writing simple functional programs in Racket</li>
<li><strong>CS4992 “Hack Your Own Language”</strong>: Build a DSL in Racket (my group built a JavaDoc-like extension, which parses documentation into Scribble and checks examples)</li>
<li><strong>CS2800 Logic and Computation</strong>: Basic theorem proving with ACL2s</li>
<li><strong>CS4800 Algorithms and Data</strong>: Basic algorithms</li>
<li><strong>CS3650 Systems</strong>: Low-level systems programming (e.g. assembly) and optimization</li>
<li><strong>CS4550 Web Development</strong>: Client (jQuery, React, Angular, Elm), server (Java + Spring Boot, node.js express, Elixir + Phoenix), Database (MySQL + JPA, PostgreSQL + Ecto, MongoDB)</li>
<li><strong>CS4992 Directed Study</strong>: Read various papers (abstract interpretation, control flow analysis in Scheme, STM) and wrote summaries / implemented the algorithms</li>
<li><strong>ENGW3301 Advanced Writing</strong>: Technical writing to different audiences (e.g. research paper, portfolio)</li>
<li><strong>CS4910 Verified Compilers</strong>: Build Toy languages / compiler passes in Coq, and prove via simulation relations that the passes preserve semantics</li>
<li><strong>CS4500 Software Development</strong>: Collaboratively develop an application in an industry-like scenario, writing design documents and leading / paneling code walks</li>
<li><strong>CS4200 Networks and Distributed Systems</strong>: High-level overview of how networks and distributed systems work: the ISO-OSI stack, and examples of layer implementations / protocols / distributed systems used in practice (e.g. Ethernet, TCP, Paxos, HTTP)</li>
<li><strong>CS4410 Compilers</strong>: Followed <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Compiler-Implementation-Andrew-Appel-ebook/dp/B00D2WQAE8">Modern Compiler Implementation in ML</a></em> and built a Tiger compiler to MIPS (lexer, parser, static semantics, IR generator, assembler, liveness / dataflow analysis, register allocation with coalescing)</li>
</ul>
<p>While at Northeastern, I’ve also attended numerous hackathons and clubs, and presented a poster at <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/rise/">RISE</a> (a small University expo) on a side project, <strong>TreeScript</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="nuprl">NuPRL</h3>
<p>Furthermore, I worked at <a href="http://prl.ccs.neu.edu/">Northeastern’s Programming Research Laboratory (PRL)</a> on an R JIT compiler called <a href="https://github.com/reactorlabs/rir">RIR</a>, with a large team. My specific contributions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating micro-benchmarks for individual components (e.g. while loops), and profiling them</li>
<li>“Simple ranges”: an optimization pass which compiles <code>for (i in a:b) ...</code> into a C-style while loop, avoiding range allocation</li>
<li>Improved type inference and “type assertions”, which validate the inferred types are actually correct in debug mode</li>
<li>Bytecode serialization / deserialization, so we don’t need to recompile the same function across sessions</li>
<li>Experimented with manually adding extra annotations to functions to improve analysis / optimization, and checking these annotations at runtime</li>
<li>Specifically, I added an assertion that a function won’t modify variables outside of its lexical scope. In the R REPL, if a variable gets modified during execution of said function, the interpreter will signal an error and abort the current command.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have published one paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05118">R Melts Brains</a>. It describes the challenges of implementing a JIT compiler with static analysis in R, mainly because of laziness and first-class environments.</p>
<h2 id="prlprg-internship-january-2020---june-2020-pending">PRL@PRG Internship: January 2020 - June 2020 (pending)</h2>
<p>I’m currently a assistant researcher at the <a href="https://prl-prg.github.io/">&lt;PRL@PRG&gt;</a> lab in Prague, supervised by Jan Vitek. Right now I continue to work on RIR.</p>
